   ## 📚 Course Structure

   1️⃣ **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**  
      - Project: Implement a perceptron to solve AND, XOR, and other logic gates.

   2️⃣ **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
      - Project: Train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification.

   3️⃣ **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**  
      - Project: Perform text prediction using LSTM networks.

   4️⃣ **Transformers**  
      - Project: Implement text prediction using transformer-based models.

   Each project is provided as a **Jupyter Notebook** that learners must complete.
